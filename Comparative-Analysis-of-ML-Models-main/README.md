+ Classified the levels of anxiety among different age groups by various Machine Learning algorithms to predict the level of anxiety.
+ Conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a diverse dataset to gain insights into underlying patterns and trends.
+ Implemented and compared various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to assess their prediction performance.
+ Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and enhance model efficiency.
+ Utilized GridSearchCV to fine-tune model hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
+  Employed K-Fold Cross Validation to evaluate model accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores, providing a robust assessment of model performance.
